## [Visit Site](https://ms3-project-arikescookbook.herokuapp.com/)

The idea of creating this project was birthed from my passion for cooking. I have always had the desire and vision to publish a cookbook someday, so when the opportunity for this project came along, I thought this is a great opportunity to make my long awaited dream happen. I have chosen the African-Caribbean theme as I believe it will help many from these group to overcome the day-to-day challenge of what to prepare for the family due to some known limitations in food varieties.

Given that the World has become a global village through the internet, I strongly believe having a pool of recipes that could be easily accessed online will help many wives, mothers, husbands, fathers, young or old and many more to combat the above mentioned challenge. Besides this, it will also help many people from all walks of life, races, ethnic groups, backgrounds e.t.c who may want to explore cooking dishes from Africa or the Caribbean. 

I beieve, Arike's cookbook will become and is the place to visit in this regard.

Thank you and enjoy the ride. :rocket:
