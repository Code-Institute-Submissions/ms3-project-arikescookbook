## [Visit Site](https://ms3-project-arikescookbook.herokuapp.com/)

The idea of creating this project was birthed from my passion for cooking. I have always had the desire and vision to publish a cookbook someday, so when the opportunity for this project came along, I thought this is a great opportunity to make my long awaited dream happen. I have chosen the African-Caribbean theme as I believe it will help many from these group to overcome the day-to-day challenge of what to prepare for the family due to some known limitations in food varieties.

Given that the World has become a global village through the internet, I strongly believe having a pool of recipes that could be easily accessed online will help many wives, mothers, husbands, fathers, young or old and many more to combat the above mentioned challenge. Besides this, it will also help many people from all walks of life, races, ethnic groups, backgrounds e.t.c who may want to explore cooking dishes from Africa or the Caribbean. 

I believe, Arike's cookbook will become and is the place to visit in this regard cause we are passionate about good food. :smile:

Thank you and enjoy the ride. :rocket:


## UX

This project was created to meet the needs of a vast majority of people. Below are a few _User Stories_:

* 'As a potential user who is looking for some Afro-Caribbean recipes, on visiting your site, I want to be able to view some simple and easy to make recipes with the freedom to possibly create and share my own idea.'

* 'As a wife/mother who wants to create a food timetable, I need a list of African or Caribbean recipes that will help me to easily achieve this'

* 'As a cookery tutor, I need some recipes to help teach my class a new dish from some specific continents and I will also require them to be able to come up with their own ideas by creating a recipe I can view and edit online.'

* 'As a developer, I want to meet the above needs by creating a cookbook site to help a wide range of people who will be able to create, read, update or delete any recipe from the site.'

In order to meet the requirements of the users, I began to brainstorm on what to do and how to go about it so as to deliver the desired result. I then visited similar sites online and those created by other code institute students which helped me to make an informed decision. After which I began creating the wireframe designs of my proposed website on Balsamiq [please see file attached under uxdesign folder located in the static folder](https://github.com/Dorcas-Amoo/ms3-project-arikescookbook). This helped me to really put a deeper thought into the idea, the layout, colour-scheme and many more and I am please with the result so far.
